# Checkers Game with AI
This project is a classic Checkers game built using Python and Tkinter, featuring an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The game is designed to provide a challenging and enjoyable experience, allowing players to test their skills against varying levels of AI difficulty.

# Key Features:
- Interactive Gameplay: Play as the white pieces against an AI opponent.
- AI Smartness Adjustment: Choose the AI difficulty level before starting the game.
- Classic Rules: Includes piece capturing, king promotion, and win conditions based on standard Checkers rules.
- Highlight Moves: Visual indicators for possible moves, making it easier to plan strategies.
- AI with Minimax Algorithm: The AI uses depth-limited Minimax with alpha-beta pruning to make smart decisions.
- Customizable Depth: Adjust the depth of the AI's calculations for varying challenge levels.

# How to Play:
- Adjust the AI smartness level using the "-" or "+" buttons.
- Click "Start Game" to begin.
- Select a piece and click on the highlighted square to make a move.
- Watch the AI make its move, then continue playing.
- The game ends when one player either captures all opponent pieces or blocks all legal moves.

# Tech Stack:
- Language: Python
- GUI Framework: Tkinter
- Algorithm: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- Deep Copying: Used for evaluating potential board states.
